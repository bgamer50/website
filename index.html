<h>About</h>
<p>
Welcome to the official website of Alex Barghi.  Here I have some of the projects I have been working on as well as general information about myself.  I am an aspiring computer engineer and rising freshman at the University of Maryland.  I have been involved in web design and IT for startups and nonprofit organizations such as Mobile Halftime and SPUG Global.  My programming knowledge includes Java, Python, C, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  My most recent project, RoadBuilder was built as a research project for the TJHSST Computer Systems Research Laboratory, and has been released on GitHub.  The most recent stable version of RoadBuilder can be found <a href='http://roadbuilder.abarghi.com'>here</a>.<br/><br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
On the side, I also run, swim, and bike with the hope of participating in triathlon competitions in the near future.  I also play competitive Super Smash Bros. (Usually Project M, maining Link) and the occasional game of Civilization V.  I live in the DC Metro Area and have been a Virginia resident for over ten years.<br/><br/><br/>
